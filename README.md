# TODO

- quantizer mode has option to limit the amount of keys to be active
- FLASH for saving most recent state on power off
- Sequencer Gate output instead of trigger output
- Note override in quantizer / loop mode (when key touched, only output that voltage). This should only be possible when holding the FREEZE button down.
- Root Note adjustments / offset
- Copy/Paste Recorded Sequence to other channels
- Auto Calibration UI
- MIDI implementation
- Record octave changes
- dim octave LED being output in qunatizer mode
- Start Every channel in the middle octave
- Clock multiplier / divider per channel
- Should REC being held down mean loop can be over-dubbed?
- FREEZE should contrinue loop sequence, but only at a pre-set number of steps - creating loop "windows". In other words, freeze actually just cuts the current loop by certain divisions ie. 8 step loop cus down to 4, then 2, then 1 etc.
